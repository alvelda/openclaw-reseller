## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `⌘ + Shift + O` | Open/focus OpenClaw |
| `⌘ + Enter` | Send message |
| `⌘ + N` | New conversation |
| `⌘ + K` | Quick command palette |

### Getting Better Results

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "write an email," try "write a professional email to my manager asking for time off next Friday"

2. **Provide context**: "I'm working on a Python project that processes CSV files. How do I..."

3. **Ask follow-ups**: If the first response isn't quite right, ask OpenClaw to revise or clarify

4. **Use examples**: "Write something similar to this: [paste example]"
